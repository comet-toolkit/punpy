\section{SIL Assessment}\label{SIL-assessment}
An assessment is made of the criticality of usage (CU) and the complexity of the program (CP) using the NPL guidelines (see paragraph 6.3 of procedure QPNPL/M/013). The criticality of usage relates to the degree of impact that the software has on the service. The complexity of program relates to how the development team views the program. The Software Integrity Level (SIL) is then derived as being level 3: 

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
Criticality         & Substantial              & CU 3  \\
Complexity          & Moderate 	    & CP 3 \\
Moderating factors  & Modular approach         & Decrease \\
                    & More than one person developing the software & Increase \\ \midrule
\textbf{Assessment} &                                              & \textbf{SIL3}  \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
