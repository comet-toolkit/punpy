\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This the quality documentation for the punpy software package.
The punpy module is a Python software package to propagate random, structured and systematic uncertainties through a given measurement function. Quality documentation typically consists of the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item User requirements: defined in the statement of work for this project.

\item Functional requirements: Included as a separate document in this folder as `punpy\_functional\_requirements.docx'.

\item Software design: Described using UML diagrams in Section \ref{design}.

\item Test report: An automated test report is given in Section \ref{testreport}. This includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item A table detailing the environment that was used during testing.
\item A summary of the results, indicating how many tests passed and how long it took.
\item A table showing each of the tests that was run, how long they took, and what output was captured during testing.
\item A test coverage report, showing how many lines of the software were covered by the combined tests.
\end{itemize}
\item User Manual: The punpy documentation is included as Appendix \ref{UserManual}. This includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Installation guidelines.
\item Overview of methods.
\item Examples of use.
\item Algorithm theoretical Basis.
\item Sphinx automated API documentation from docstrings in python code.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
